Full window ARPS.fi map
================================

This is a scrappy solution for an embeded map generated by aprs.fi so it can be displayed full height and width on 


Settings
--------
You can edit settings.js file to specify settings for your tracking based on insrtuctions found here:
http://aprs.fi/page/embed


Limitations
-----------
Due to time constrains (we are off for a ride!) the full view works for the request window. No dynamic resizing is done.

Licence
